If the final customer demand were constant, supply chain management (SCM) would simply be a
backwards scheduling exercise. However, the demand is unknown and changeable and it must
therefore be forecasted. The uncertainty surrounding this forecast is where the complexity of SCM
arises and, in this regard, more accurate forecasts will result in a better overall supply chain
performance. My thesis examined various applications of data analytics in SCM, in particular the
application of demand forecasting techniques.

My thesis was conducted using data from the 2020 MSOM Data Drive Research Challenge.
To support the 2020 MSOM Data Driven Research Challenge, JD.com, China’s largest retailer,
offers transaction level data to MSOM members for conducting data-driven research. This article
describes the transactional data associated with over 2.5 million customers (anonymized) and
31,868 SKUs over the month of March in 2018.
